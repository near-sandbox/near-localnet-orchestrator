## Layer 3 in the 5-layer NEAR localnet simulator stack (context only)

### The 5-layer stack (only what Layer 3 needs)
- **Layer 1: NEAR Base** (`AWSNodeRunner`)
  - Provides: NEAR RPC endpoint + VPC network where everything lives.
  - Required by Layer 3: `rpc_url`, `vpc_id`, `instance_id/private_ip` (for VPC-only access/SSM).

- **Layer 2: NEAR Services** (`near-localnet-services`)
  - Provides: core contracts + faucet (utility layer).
  - Required by Layer 3: not strictly required for MPC boot, but often used for funding/setup and overall parity.

- **Layer 3: Chain Signatures (THIS)** (`cross-chain-simulator` + embedded `mpc-repo`)
  - Owns: MPC node infra (EC2) + `v1.signer` contract deployment/initialization + node accounts.
  - Produces: `v1_signer_contract_id`, MPC node endpoints, and a “chain_signatures_config” blob for higher layers.

### What Layer 3 must do (contract + infra responsibilities)
Layer 3 is complete only when:
- MPC infra exists (EC2 nodes created) and nodes are **running** (not restarting).
- Required secrets are present (non-placeholder) for node runtime.
- On-chain hierarchy exists and is consistent:
  - `localnet` (root; created in genesis by Layer 1)
  - `signer.localnet`
  - `v1.signer.localnet` (contract account with code)
  - `mpc-node-*.localnet` (participants)
- Contract is initialized and ready for signing workflow.

### What is already built (we are building on this)
- Orchestrator deploy order: `near_base → ethereum_localnet → near_services → chain_signatures`.
- Layer 3 naming default: `.localnet` (master `localnet`, contract `v1.signer.localnet`, nodes `mpc-node-*.localnet`).
- Layer 2 core-contract deployment is executed inside the VPC (SSM on NEAR base EC2).

### What is explicitly NOT part of Layer 3 scope
- No wallet/explorer/indexer (developer tooling belongs later).
- No Layer 4/5 feature work here.
- No architecture changes: Layer 3 must remain “MPC infra + v1.signer contract + config outputs”.

### Outputs (contract + infra)
Minimum outputs for higher layers:
- `near_rpc_url`
- `v1_signer_contract_id` (expected default: `v1.signer.localnet`)
- `mpc_node_{i}_url` or equivalent list of MPC endpoints
